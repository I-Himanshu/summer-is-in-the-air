The summer night is like a perfection of thought.

Friends, sun, sand, and sea, that sounds like a summer to me.

Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summerâ€™s day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.
